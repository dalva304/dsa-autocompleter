# dsa-autocompleter

Developed an efficient autocompleter as part of my coursework, utilizing an AVL tree structure in C++. This project allowed me to explore dynamic string insertion into a dictionary, track the total number of entries, and retrieve the three most-frequent completions for given inputs, achieving O(1) time complexity for certain operations.

Key features of the project include:
- **Insertion Mechanism**: I implemented a trie-based structure to manage string completions, ensuring that the top three most frequent entries were updated with each new insertion.
- **Count Management**: I maintained an accurate count of total entries, enabling quick retrieval of the size of the dictionary.
- **Completion Extraction**: Designed a streamlined method for efficiently retrieving relevant suggestions, allowing for rapid access without unnecessary searches.

This project enhanced my understanding of advanced data structures and algorithms, while also emphasizing the importance of efficient memory management and performance optimization in software development.
